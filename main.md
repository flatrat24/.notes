### Snippets
  - add \mapsto as an option for -r
  - add trig snippets
  - Add a Laplace Transform snippet (\mathcal{L}\left\{\right\}) with choice for inverse
  - Add \Big\vert_{insert \mapsto insert}
  - Piecewise function
  - leq, geq, other inequalities/equalities
  - \mathcal{} for general letters
  - change draw/node snippets to fit with global styling 
  - change (( and )) snippets to be general to any bracket as well as doing both left and right at once: () as the trigger?
  - fix multiline to multline in equation snippet
## LaTeX
  - Make global styling variables (body, dimension, line, etc.)
  - make stealth the default arrow
